A video demonstration of how the tool operates:

This is a concise demonstration of a fully functional certificate authority

It has 2 modes: 
1. Manual 
2. Automatic

* Manual Mode allows you to perform each step individually and you can choose what steps to perform

* Automatic mode takes the domain as input and runs all the functions
